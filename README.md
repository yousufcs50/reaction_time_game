# Reaction Time Tester Game

\
*An engaging game to test your reaction speed, inspired by Formula 1 starting lights!*

## 🚀 Overview

This **Reaction Time Tester Game** is a fun web application that tests how fast you can react to visual signals, inspired by the starting lights of an F1 race. You can see a series of lights turn from red to green, and you need to click as soon as they go green! Track your reaction times and compete to see how fast you really are.

## ✨ Features

- **F1-Inspired Lights**: Five red lights turn on one by one, creating anticipation, before switching to green.
- **Random Timing**: Random delays make it impossible to predict when the green light will appear, keeping you on your toes.
- **Leaderboard**: Compare your reaction times against others with a top leaderboard.
- **Simple and Elegant Design**: Clean, minimalistic user interface that is easy to use.
